# projectAledav
a websocket project

Please use this project as a base point for future multiplayer games. It has the basic server-client and p2p communication set up as well as some neat classes for QoL.
The websocket is hardcoded in so please change that upon changing the websocket server(if it happens)

files: there is the index.html file which serves mostly for having 2 quare divs (for testing practices), and the style.css file which is used for styling the boxes.
In the client.js file there is some basic message processing set up
as well as the "square controller event listener" and some other minor stuff. 
In the server.js file there are some basic server processing things set up,
most of which have to be improved/changed(its possible this readme wont change even tho they will be fixed)
